Etsy gives clear rules to sellers: No Child or Youth Labor, No Involuntary or Slave Labor, Humane Working Conditions, and Non-Discrimination. However, regulation of these rules are not constant. In 2020, Etsy failed to remove the influx of shops selling handmade mesh masks that falsely advertised to protect shoppers from COVID-19, and Etsy may have caused risk to public health by failing to do so. Additionally, Etsy has partnered with 3Degrees to combat climate change by offsetting the Carbon footprint of their shipping packages. All in all, Etsy may be a better alternative to corporations that fail to pay their workers fairly as most Etsy shops are self-made goods, but the environmental cost of shipping, and the types of materials used in each product can affect its ethical impact. Exercise caution when perusing Etsy, and if you'd like our input on a specific product, please send us an email!
